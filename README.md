# unity-tetrahedron-tree

## A simple demo containing a procedurally generated tree shape composed of tetrahedrons. (triangular pyramids)

This is an idea that got stuck my head and I had to try it out. "How would it look if I made a tree out of pyramids?" 
Result: Beautiful abstract art trees that would not be amiss in any surreal or alien landscape.

This project demonstrates an approach to:

1. create a tetrahedron shape.
2. combine multiple tetrahedrons into a larger tree shape, based on a random seed.
3. converting the tree into a triangle mesh for rendering.
